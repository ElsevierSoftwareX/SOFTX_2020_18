# PyIVNS
A python based tool for Interval-valued neutrosophic operations and normalization

There are two main functions illustrated in the top menu of the software.
1.	IVNS operation 
2.	Neutrosophic matrix normalization   

# Ivns operations contain the following functions:
•	Calculate complement , product scalar , power scalar of ivns matrix.
•	Calculate Karasan score , Ridvan score ,and Nancy score for ivns matrix.
•	Calculate the intersection, union , addition, difference ,multiplication  of two ivns matrices.
 
 # Neutrosophic matrix normalization performs following functions for beneficial and non-beneficial matrix: 
•	Linear normalization.
•	Linear normalization (maximum and minimum )
•	Linear normalization (Summation) 
•	Vector Normalization 
•	Enhanced Accuracy Normalization.
