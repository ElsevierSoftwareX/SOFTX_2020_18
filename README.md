# PyIVNS
A python based tool for Interval-valued neutrosophic operations and normalization

There are two main functions illustrated in the top menu of the software.
1.	IVNS operation 
2.	Neutrosophic matrix normalization   

# Ivns operations :
contain the following functions.  <br/>
•	Calculate complement , product scalar , power scalar of ivns matrix. <br/> 
•	Calculate Karasan score , Ridvan score ,and Nancy score for ivns matrix. <br/>
•	Calculate the intersection, union , addition, difference ,multiplication  of two ivns matrices.<br/>
 
 # Neutrosophic matrix normalization : 
 performs following functions for beneficial and non-beneficial matrix.
 •	Linear normalization.
•	Linear normalization (maximum and minimum )
•	Linear normalization (Summation) 
•	Vector Normalization 
•	Enhanced Accuracy Normalization.
