# PyIVNS
A python based tool for Interval-valued neutrosophic operations and normalization

There are two main functions illustrated in the top menu of the software.
1.	IVNS operation 
2.	Neutrosophic matrix normalization   

# Ivns operations :
Contain the following functions.  <br/>
   •	Calculate complement , product scalar , power scalar of ivns matrix. <br/> 
   •	Calculate Karasan score , Ridvan score ,and Nancy score for ivns matrix. <br/>
   •	Calculate the intersection, union , addition, difference ,multiplication  of two ivns matrices.<br/>
 
 # Neutrosophic matrix normalization : 
 Performs following functions for beneficial and non-beneficial matrix.<br/> 
   •	Linear normalization.<br/> 
   •	Linear normalization (maximum and minimum )<br/> 
   •	Linear normalization (Summation) <br/> 
   •	Vector Normalization <br/> 
   •	Enhanced Accuracy Normalization.<br/>
